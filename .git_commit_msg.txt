feat(ui): add Edit button + iteration to generation and edits

- Add an " Edit" button (ImageIterationView) to generation completion embeds so users can open a modal and enqueue an edit using one of the generated images.
- Attach the same iteration view (Reroll, Variations, Same Seed, Edit) to edit completion embeds so users can continue iterating on edited outputs.
- Fix broken/empty attachment sending by writing generated/edited image bytes to disk (CACHE_DIR) and creating fresh discord.File objects from disk before sending. This avoids re-using consumed BytesIO file-like objects.
- Accept both GeneratedImage objects and local file path strings in the iteration flow; the Edit modal accepts an index and will enqueue edits using local file paths when present.
- Improve cleanup: ensure temp files written to CACHE_DIR are tracked and removed after processing.
- Update README.md with a new "Recent changes" section explaining the UX improvements and testing steps.

Files changed: src/commands/utils/queue.py, README.md, pyproject.toml

Notes: this change preserves existing APIs and command signatures; it focuses on UX and reliability of iteration/edit flows.
